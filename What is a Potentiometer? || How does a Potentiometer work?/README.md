üß∞ **Required Components**
- Potentiometer (typically 10kŒ©)
- LED
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply (e.g., 9V battery)
- (Optional) Digital multimeter for resistance measurement[1]

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact (wiper) that acts as an adjustable voltage divider.
- Rotating the potentiometer knob changes the position of the wiper, adjusting the resistance between the terminals.
- In the demonstration, the potentiometer is used to control the brightness of an LED: as the resistance is increased, less current flows to the LED, dimming it; as resistance decreases, the LED gets brighter[1].
- The potentiometer can also be used as a variable resistor (rheostat) by connecting only two terminals, or as a voltage divider by using all three terminals[1][2].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The potential drop across any section of the potentiometer wire is directly proportional to its length, assuming uniform cross-section and current[3].
- By moving the wiper, you change the length of the resistive path, thus varying the voltage at the wiper terminal.
- This allows precise adjustment of voltage or resistance in a circuit, making the potentiometer useful for calibration and control[4][3].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Volume and tone control in audio equipment[5]
- Light dimming (as shown with the LED)
- Calibration and testing of electronic circuits and instruments[6][7]
- Position sensing in industrial automation[7]
- Feedback devices in control systems (e.g., servo position, speed, temperature regulation)[6][7]
- Sensing and monitoring physical parameters like displacement or fluid level[6][7]

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Integrate with a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to read analog values and control more complex outputs (motors, displays)[2]
- Use a digital potentiometer for remote or automated adjustments
- Add an LCD or serial monitor to display real-time resistance or voltage values
- Combine with other sensors for multi-parameter control (e.g., temperature and brightness)
- Implement multi-turn potentiometers for finer adjustment in precision applications[7]
