## Required Components

- Arduino Uno R3
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (typically HC-SR04)
- Connecting wires (jumper wires)
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
- Computer with Arduino IDE (for coding and simulation, especially if using TinkerCAD)[^1]


## How It Works

The ultrasonic sensor has two main parts: a transmitter (Trig) and a receiver (Echo). The Arduino sends a signal to the Trig pin, causing the sensor to emit an ultrasonic pulse. When this pulse hits an object, it reflects back and is detected by the Echo pin. The Arduino measures the time between sending and receiving the pulse, then calculates the distance to the object using the speed of sound. The measured distance is displayed in real time on the serial monitor[^1].

## Working Principle

The project relies on the time-of-flight principle for sound waves. The Arduino triggers the ultrasonic sensor to emit a sound pulse. It then measures the time it takes for the pulse to travel to an object and return. The distance is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Time} \times 0.034}{2}
$$

where 0.034 cm/μs is the approximate speed of sound in air, and the division by 2 accounts for the round trip of the pulse[^1].

## Applications

- Obstacle detection for robots
- Distance measurement tools
- Parking assistance systems
- Level measurement in tanks
- Security and automation systems[^1]


## Optional Enhancements

- Displaying the measured distance on an LCD or OLED screen
- Adding a buzzer or LED to alert when an object is too close
- Integrating with wireless modules (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote monitoring
- Using multiple sensors for 360-degree obstacle detection
- Logging data to an SD card for analysis
