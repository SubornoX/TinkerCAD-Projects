üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino board
- PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The PIR sensor detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation (heat) from moving objects, such as people or animals.
- The sensor outputs a HIGH signal when motion is detected and LOW when no motion is present.
- The Arduino reads this digital signal from the PIR sensor and can trigger actions (like turning on an LED or sounding a buzzer) based on motion detection[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The PIR sensor contains a pair of pyroelectric sensors that detect infrared radiation.
- When an object with a different temperature (such as a human body) passes in front of the sensor, the infrared energy detected changes, causing the sensor to output a digital signal.
- The Arduino monitors this signal and executes programmed responses when motion is detected[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Automated lighting systems (lights turn on when motion is detected)
- Security and intruder alarm systems
- Occupancy detection for energy saving
- Smart home automation
- Motion-activated cameras or alerts

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add a relay to control AC appliances based on motion.
- Integrate with an alarm or buzzer for security notifications.
- Use an LCD or serial monitor to display motion status or event count.
- Combine with wireless modules (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) for remote alerts.
- Log motion events to an SD card for monitoring activity over time.
