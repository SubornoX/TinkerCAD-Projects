🧰 **Required Components**  
- Arduino UNO board[1]  
- 4 × 4 membrane keypad[1]  
- Breadboard (for tidy prototyping)  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable (to program & power the Arduino)  

⚙️ **How It Works**  
- The keypad’s **4 row lines (R1–R4) are connected to Arduino digital pins 9, 8, 7, 6**, while the **4 column lines (C1–C4) go to pins 5, 4, 3, 2**[1].  
- The sketch includes **Keypad.h by Mark Stanley & Alexander Brevig** to handle matrix scanning and key decoding[1].  
- A 4 × 4 character map (1-9, 0, arithmetic symbols, *, #, etc.) is defined; when a key is pressed the library returns the corresponding character[1].  
- Inside loop(), `keypad.getKey()` captures each press; the character is sent to the Serial Monitor with the message “Key Pressed = ”[1].  

🔬 **Working Principle**  
- A matrix keypad ties every button between one row and one column line.  
- The microcontroller sets either rows or columns as outputs and the others as inputs; by driving rows low/high in sequence and checking columns, it identifies the single intersecting line pair that closes when a button is pressed (matrix scanning).  
- The Keypad library automates this scanning, debounces contacts, and delivers the detected character to the user sketch.  

🏷️ **Applications**  
- Code or password entry systems (locks, alarms)  
- Calculator, menu, or numeric data input for embedded devices  
- DIY home-automation control panels  
- Small games or quiz buzzers requiring multiple buttons  

✨ **Optional Enhancements**  
- Add an LCD/OLED to display the typed digits or menu selections.  
- Combine with a relay or servo to build an electronic door lock.  
- Store multi-digit PINs in EEPROM for persistent access control.  
- Implement audio or LED feedback (beep / blink) on keypress.  
- Upgrade to I²C port-expander chips to free Arduino I/O pins when using larger keypads.
