üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino Uno R3
- LED
- Resistor[1]

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The LED is connected in series with a resistor to an output pin of the Arduino Uno.
- The Arduino is programmed to send a HIGH signal (turning the LED on) and a LOW signal (turning the LED off) to the LED pin, with a delay in between.
- This cycle repeats, causing the LED to blink at a regular interval[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The Arduino uses digital output to control the LED.
- By switching the voltage on the output pin between HIGH (5V) and LOW (0V), the Arduino turns the LED on and off.
- The resistor limits the current to prevent damage to the LED and Arduino pin[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Basic microcontroller learning and testing
- Visual status indicators in embedded systems
- Debugging tool to confirm code execution or hardware status
- Foundation for more advanced timing and control projects

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Adjust the blink rate by changing the delay value in the code.
- Add multiple LEDs for patterns or sequences.
- Use a button to control the blinking.
- Integrate a buzzer or other output devices for multi-modal feedback.
- Expand the project to include sensor-triggered blinking.
