üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino board
- Breadboard
- Photodiode
- 220Œ© resistor
- Jumper wires

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The photodiode is connected to the Arduino via a breadboard.
- The cathode of the photodiode is connected to the Arduino‚Äôs ground (GND).
- A 220Œ© resistor is connected in series with the photodiode to limit current and protect the diode.
- The other terminal of the resistor is connected to one of Arduino‚Äôs analog input pins (A0).
- When light falls on the photodiode, its resistance decreases, allowing more current to flow, which changes the voltage read by the analog pin.
- The Arduino reads this analog value and displays it on the serial monitor, showing changes as light intensity varies[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The photodiode acts as a light sensor: when photons hit the diode, they generate current proportional to the light intensity.
- Increased light decreases the photodiode‚Äôs resistance, increasing the current and changing the voltage at the analog input.
- Arduino‚Äôs analogRead() function measures this voltage, allowing the system to detect and quantify changes in light levels[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Light intensity measurement
- Automatic lighting systems
- Security and intrusion detection (light beam interruption)
- Solar tracking systems
- Basic optical communication

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add an LCD display to show real-time light intensity values.
- Use the photodiode to trigger alarms or activate devices when light levels cross a threshold.
- Interface with wireless modules (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote monitoring.
- Log sensor data to an SD card for analysis.
- Combine with multiple photodiodes for directional light sensing or tracking.
