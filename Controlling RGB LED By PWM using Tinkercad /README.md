üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino board
- RGB LED (common cathode or anode)
- 3 current-limiting resistors (typically 220Œ©)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The RGB LED has three separate LEDs (red, green, blue) housed in a single package, each controlled by a separate Arduino PWM-capable pin.
- By adjusting the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals sent to each color channel, the Arduino can mix red, green, and blue in varying intensities to produce a wide range of colors.
- The code allows you to change the color output by modifying the PWM values for each channel, creating custom colors or smooth color transitions[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- PWM allows the Arduino to simulate analog output by rapidly switching the LED pins on and off at different duty cycles.
- The perceived brightness of each color channel is controlled by its respective PWM value.
- By combining different brightness levels of red, green, and blue, the RGB LED emits different colors, leveraging the principle of additive color mixing[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Decorative and ambient lighting
- Status or notification indicators
- Mood lighting systems
- Educational demonstrations of color mixing and PWM control
- Customizable visual feedback in interactive projects

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add potentiometers or buttons to manually adjust each color channel.
- Use sensors (e.g., light, temperature) to change colors automatically.
- Program smooth color-fading effects or animations.
- Integrate remote or wireless control (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for color selection.
- Display current color values on an LCD or serial monitor.
