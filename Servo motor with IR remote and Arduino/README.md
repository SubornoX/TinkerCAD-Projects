üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino UNO board
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- IR Sensor
- IR Remote
- Servo Motor[1]

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The IR sensor receives signals from the IR remote when a button is pressed.
- Arduino reads and decodes the IR signal using an appropriate library.
- Depending on which button is pressed, the Arduino sends a command to the servo motor to rotate to a specific angle.
- This allows wireless control of the servo motor‚Äôs position using the remote[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The IR remote emits modulated infrared signals, each button corresponding to a unique code.
- The IR sensor detects these signals and converts them into electrical pulses.
- Arduino interprets the code and, based on pre-programmed instructions, drives the servo motor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to set its angle[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Wireless robotic arm control
- Remote-controlled door locks or latches
- Home automation (e.g., adjusting blinds, opening/closing vents)
- Educational robotics and DIY automation projects[1]

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add an LCD display to show the current servo angle.
- Use multiple servos for more complex movements.
- Integrate feedback sensors for precise positioning.
- Expand to control other actuators (motors, relays) with the same remote.
- Implement preset position memory or sequences[1].
