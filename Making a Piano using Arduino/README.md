### üß∞ Required Components
- Arduino UNO board
- Push buttons (typically 8 for an octave)
- Buzzer or piezo speaker
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- (Optional) Resistors for button debouncing

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Each push button is connected to a digital input pin on the Arduino.
- The other side of each button is connected to ground, with internal or external pull-up resistors ensuring stable readings.
- A buzzer or piezo speaker is connected to a PWM-capable digital output pin.
- When a button is pressed, the Arduino detects which button is active and generates a specific frequency on the buzzer, corresponding to a musical note.
- Each button produces a different tone, allowing you to play simple melodies like a piano.

### üî¨ Working Principle
- The Arduino uses the `tone()` function to generate square wave signals of specific frequencies for the buzzer.
- Each button is mapped to a musical note (e.g., C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C).
- When a button is pressed, its corresponding note frequency is sent to the buzzer until the button is released.

### üè∑Ô∏è Applications
- Educational tool for learning about sound, frequencies, and Arduino programming
- DIY electronic musical instruments
- Interactive STEM projects for students

### ‚ú® Optional Enhancements
- Add more buttons for additional notes or octaves
- Use an LCD to display the note being played
- Implement polyphony (multiple notes at once) with more advanced hardware
- Integrate with MIDI for digital music production
