üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino board
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for easier connections)

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The servo motor is connected to the Arduino: the signal wire goes to a digital PWM-capable pin, while power and ground connect to 5V and GND.
- The Arduino sends PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to the servo, controlling its shaft position.
- By changing the PWM signal‚Äôs pulse width, the Arduino can rotate the servo to a specific angle, typically within a 0‚Äì180¬∞ range.

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The servo motor operates based on the width of the incoming PWM pulses.
- The Arduino‚Äôs Servo library simplifies sending these pulses: you specify the desired angle, and the library generates the correct signal.
- The servo‚Äôs internal circuitry interprets the pulse width and moves the shaft accordingly, using feedback for precise positioning.

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Robotic arms and grippers
- Automated door locks
- Camera pan/tilt mechanisms
- Model vehicles (steering, flaps)
- Home automation (e.g., opening vents, adjusting blinds)

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add a potentiometer for manual angle control.
- Use multiple servos for more complex motion.
- Integrate with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR) for interactive projects.
- Control via wireless modules (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
- Display servo angle on an LCD or serial monitor.
