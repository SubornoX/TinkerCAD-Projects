### üß∞ Required Components
- Arduino UNO board
- 4√ó4 matrix keypad
- 16√ó2 LCD display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The **4√ó4 keypad** is used for numeric and operator input (digits 0‚Äì9, +, ‚Äì, √ó, √∑, =, C).
- The **16√ó2 LCD** displays the numbers entered, the chosen operation, and the result.
- The Arduino reads key presses from the keypad, processes the input, performs calculations, and updates the LCD with the current value or result.
- The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### üî¨ Working Principle
- The keypad is interfaced with the Arduino using digital pins, and the LCD is connected in 4-bit mode.
- The Arduino code scans the keypad matrix to detect which key is pressed.
- When a number or operator is pressed, it is stored and displayed on the LCD.
- Pressing '=' triggers the calculation, and the result is shown on the LCD.
- The 'C' key clears the input for a new calculation.

### üè∑Ô∏è Applications
- Educational tool for learning about microcontroller interfacing, matrix keypads, and LCDs
- DIY desk calculator
- Foundation for more advanced embedded input/output projects

### ‚ú® Optional Enhancements
- Add support for decimal points and negative numbers
- Implement additional mathematical functions (square root, percentage, etc.)
- Use a larger display for multi-line calculations
- Add sound or LED feedback for key presses
