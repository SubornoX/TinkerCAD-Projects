🧰 **Required Components**
- Arduino board
- Temperature sensor (commonly LM35 or similar)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
- (If using TinkerCAD, all components are virtual)[1].

⚙️ **How It Works**
- The temperature sensor is connected to the Arduino, typically using an analog input pin.
- The sensor outputs a voltage proportional to the temperature.
- Arduino reads this analog voltage, converts it to a digital value, and uses a formula to calculate the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- The calculated temperature can be displayed in the serial monitor or used to trigger other actions[1].

🔬 **Working Principle**
- The temperature sensor (like LM35) operates on the principle that its output voltage is linearly proportional to the temperature.
- For example, the LM35 outputs 10 mV per °C, so at 25°C, the output would be 250 mV.
- Arduino’s ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) reads this voltage and, using code, converts it to a temperature value[1].

🏷️ **Applications**
- Room temperature monitoring
- Weather stations
- Industrial temperature control
- Smart home automation (e.g., HVAC systems)
- Educational and prototyping projects[1].

✨ **Optional Enhancements**
- Add an LCD or OLED display to show temperature readings in real time.
- Integrate buzzer or LED alerts for specific temperature thresholds.
- Log data to an SD card for analysis.
- Send temperature data wirelessly using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules.
- Use multiple sensors for multi-zone temperature monitoring.
