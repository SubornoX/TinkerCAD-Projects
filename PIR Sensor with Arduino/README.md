üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino UNO board
- PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor
- LED
- 220Œ© resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires[1]

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- The PIR sensor detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation from moving objects (like humans or animals).
- When motion is detected, the sensor outputs a HIGH signal to the Arduino.
- The Arduino reads this signal and turns on the LED as an indicator.
- When no motion is detected, the sensor outputs LOW, and the Arduino turns the LED off[1].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The PIR sensor contains pyroelectric elements that generate a signal when exposed to changing infrared levels.
- The sensor detects movement within its range by sensing the difference in heat between a moving object and the background.
- The Arduino monitors the sensor‚Äôs output pin and controls the LED based on the signal received[1].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Automatic lighting systems (lights turn on when motion is detected)
- Security alarms and intruder detection
- Occupancy sensing for energy-saving automation
- Smart home systems
- Motion-activated devices[1]

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add a buzzer for audible alerts when motion is detected.
- Use a relay to control high-power devices (fans, lamps).
- Display motion status or event count on an LCD or via the Serial Monitor.
- Integrate with wireless modules (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote notifications.
- Log motion events to an SD card for activity tracking[1].
