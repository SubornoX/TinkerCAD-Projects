üß∞ **Required Components**
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino UNO)
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3 resistors (typically 220Œ© or 100Œ©)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
- Each LED represents a different traffic signal color: red (stop), yellow (get ready), and green (go).
- The LEDs are connected to separate digital output pins on the Arduino.
- The Arduino runs a program that turns the LEDs on and off in sequence, mimicking the operation of a real traffic light: red ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red, and so on.
- Delays are used in the code to control how long each light stays on, creating the traffic light timing cycle[1][2][3].

üî¨ **Working Principle**
- The project uses digital outputs from the Arduino to control the LEDs.
- Current-limiting resistors are connected in series with each LED to prevent damage from excessive current.
- The Arduino code defines the sequence and timing for each light using digitalWrite() and delay() functions, simulating a real-world traffic light controller[1][2].

üè∑Ô∏è **Applications**
- Educational demonstrations of traffic control systems
- Prototyping for smart city and IoT traffic management
- Basic automation projects
- Learning platform for Arduino programming, digital outputs, and timing

‚ú® **Optional Enhancements**
- Add a pedestrian crossing button and signal
- Use a buzzer for audio alerts during light changes
- Integrate an LCD display to show countdown timers
- Expand to control multiple intersections (4-way traffic)
- Incorporate sensors to detect vehicle presence and adjust timing dynamically
